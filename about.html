    <h2>About</h2>
	
    <p>I am Cindy Spence, writer and editor. Also wife, mother, daughter, sister. Interested in all things Florida, the educational system, youth sports, science, books, travel, Gator sports, fitness and nutrition, almost anything in the news.</p>
    <p>As a military brat, home has always been a bit relative. I was born in Georgia and taken from the hospital to my Papa’s (my mother’s father’s) small farm because my Dad was on a temporary tour of duty. Ilived outside Atlanta before Atlanta boomed, and remember eating strawberries and cucumbers off the vines in my Papa’s garden and having a pet calf.  Home, as in a place you have roots, would be AmeliaIsland, because my paternal grandparents lived there, making it the place I always returned to. I attended 10 schools, three in the sixth grade alone. But my high school years were all spent in Panama City, Fla., also known as the Redneck Riviera.</p>
    <p>I was one of only three students in my high school graduating class to attend the University of Florida. Florida State University, closer to Panama City, was the more popular choice. To this day, I remember theincredulous, “You’re going where?” To this day, I know I made the right choice.</p>
    <p>At UF, I first lived in a dorm, then a small apartment in an old Victorian home downtown with no air conditioning. Working my way through school, I had no television and no phone. People who wanted to reach me left notes under my door or called me at The Independent Florida Alligator, where I spent most of my waking hours. The dank newsroom was then tucked into a barely renovated kitchen behind the Old College Inn (later the Purple Porpoise, of kamikaze halftime fame). It could not have been seedier or more loved. In my days as editor, I relished unlocking the door in the morning, usually the first in the newsroom with a large coffee and a fresh stack of state papers, and I relished locking it at night, the last one out after sending the paper to the printer in Ocala (and occasionally tagging along on the trip). When two law students asked me if The Alligator would join in a lawsuit challenging closed search committee meetings for the UF law dean, the choice was obvious. I was asked to lunch in then-President Robert Q. Marston’s office and asked to drop the lawsuit. I respectfully declined. The lawsuit eventually won in Florida Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>I interned at The Miami Herald and The Tampa Times. I studied journalism and anything and everything else, cutting a wide swath through courses I probably had no business taking. I ended up with enough credits for three minors and only got out because a journalism department chair signed off on my last three credits. It was time to go, he said, and he was right.</p>
    <p>My first job at The Orlando Sentinel was the night cops beat, and a different kind of education. This was in an era before news was so carefully managed, and I saw murder scenes, arsons, gang stakeouts and car wrecks up close. While on the beat, UF’s Howard Appeldorf, aka the Fast Food Professor, was murdered, and as the most recent UF graduate on staff, I was sent to Gainesville to cover that story. I went on to The Tampa Tribune, where I was the on-site editor in the Gainesville bureau coordinating and editing coverage of the Gainesvillestudent murders. It was also at the Tribune that I met a sports writer, who sold his Super Bowl tickets to help finance our wedding. True love. My journalism career ended, I guess, when I left The Tampa Tribune to freelance and raise my daughter. She was then in elementary school, and I knew something had to give the day I got so wrapped up in a news meeting to plan a four-part series that I forgot to pick her up at school. When I arrived late and saw her tear-stained face and reproachful look, it broke my heart. I gave notice soon after. I planned to return to the newspaper, but the layoffs began and so it goes. I am an example of the mid-career timeout the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/magazine/the-opt-out-generation-wants-back-in.html">New York Times Magazine</a> wrote about in August 2013. While I recognize the blow to my career, it was worth it. My daughter, now 20, is the person whose company I enjoy.</p>
    <p>I’ve been a reporter, writer and editor for three-plus decades. The newspaper profession has withered, but I don’t regret the time I spent in newsrooms. Journalists are a nutty crew, quirky and fun and never dull, and navigating the world with a press pass can’t be beat.</p>
    <p>Now, as a baby boomer graduate student, I am the proverbial fish out of water, and that’s fine, too. It’s uncomfortable, yes, but I am learning something new all the time. Fitting for a military brat.</p>
