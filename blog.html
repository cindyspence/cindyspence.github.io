<p>Before this class required it, I would not have seen myself as a blogger. I am late to the digital dance and as such the blogosphere is already well populated, perhaps overpopulated. I care about many topics, but a blog exists for all of them. So, my blog is about a digital evolution, my own. 
</p>
<p>As I say in the blog, I didn’t anticipate how much this would put me outside my comfort zone. I’m not very comfortable writing in first person and much prefer the journalist’s role of observer. But examining the digital world and my relationship to it has paid off. I do believe I am a fully vested digital citizen today.
</p>
<p>As I tackled this metamorphosis, I felt a little behind. To catch up, I read widely. Here is a partial list of books, articles and online sources I found helpful or interesting, or both: 
</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Here Comes Everybody, by Clay Shirky</li>
        <li>Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think, by Viktor Mayer-Schonberger and Kenneth Cukier</li>
        <li>Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now, by Douglas Rushkoff</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/generation-like/">Generation Like</a>, a PBS documentary by Douglas Rushkoff/</li>
        <li>Journalism Next, Entrepreneurial Journalism, by Mark Briggs</li>
        <li>You Are Not a Gadget, by Jaron Lanier</li>
        <li>Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants, by Marc Prensky, from On the Horizon</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.garciamedia.com/blog">The Daily Blog</a></li>
        <li>The Online Avengers, by Emily Bazelon, New York Times Magazine</li>
        <li>The Not-So-Lonely City, by Mark Oppenheimer, New York Times</li>
        <li>Github, Object of Nerd Love, Makes Play for Non-Programmers, by Robinson Meyer, The Atlantic</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.livescience.com/43375-why-talk-to-strangers.html">Why You Should Put Down Your Smartphone and Talk to Strangers</a>, by Stephanie Pappas, livescience.com</li>
        <li><a href="http://mediatedcultures.net/">Mediated Cultures</a>, by Michael Wesch</li>
    </ul>
<p>There’s no organization to this list; I sort of careened topic to topic, bumper car style, the common thread being the quest for a digital life.
</p>
<p>So here it is, the footprint of a digital dinosaur, on the brink of evolution: <a href="http://cindyrspence.wordpress.com/">The Last Dinosaur.</a>
