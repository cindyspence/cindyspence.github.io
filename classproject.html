    <h1>Chunking Science</h1>
    
    <h2>MMC 5015 Your Digital Life Project</h2>
		
</header>
	
<p>As a graduate student in the science and health communication track and as a writer in the University of Florida Office of Research, I have a strong interest in science news.
</p>
<p>Writing about science is a lot like newspaper reporting, it takes you places you wouldn’t have gone otherwise. I’ve flown with a weed scientist in a helicopter over a nature preserve being swallowed up by invasive vines, gone along with a wildlife researcher tagging barn owls in sugar cane fields on the edge of the Everglades and hiked through saw palmettos with a scientist studying their value as a pharmaceutical crop. I’ve held a bat and observed an alligator necropsy. Science is often fun, almost always interesting, and I almost always come away wishing I had paid more attention in long-ago chemistry and physics classes (the researchers likely wish this, too).
</p>
<p>From climate change to the ways we mine big data to the anti-science bias that rears its head in policy circles, science is a hot topic, so science news is my class project for MMC 5015 Your Digital Life, hopefully “chunked” appropriately per the professor’s instructions.
</p>
    <h2>Science is News</h2>
    
<p>The digital revolution of the last 25 years has done to the world of science what it has done to the rest of the world: quickened the pace. 
</p>
<p>As citizens of the world, all of us, digital natives and immigrants alike, try to keep up with the pace of change, learning new technologies, integrating them into our lives, then learning the next thing. Science does this, too.
</p>
<p>James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the molecular structure of DNA in 1953. When the U.S. embarked on the quest to map the human genome in 1990, scientists thought it would take 15 years and $3 billion. <a href="http://www.genome.gov/10001772">The Human Genome Project</a> took 13 years – thanks to improvements in computing power – and cost $2.7 billion. By 2003, a mere 50 years since Watson and Crick discovered the double helix, the human genome was sequenced.
</p>

<figure class="right"><img src="scimages/dnastructure.jpg" width="250" height="202" alt="dna" title="dna" class="right"/><figcaption>The Double Helix</figcaption></figure>

<p>Today, you can swab your mouth and send your DNA to any of a number of labs, and <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/for-99-eliminating-the-mystery-of-pandoras-genetic-box/?_r=0">for $99</a> find out an assortment of data points about your own genetic code.
</p>
<p>The question becomes how do we process this knowledge? Personally, and as a society, who helps us figure out what our personal genetic code really means, and who deciphers the latest discoveries in science?
</p>
<p>Traditionally, science journalists have filled this role. So who does it when the science reporters are gone, or worse, replaced by science partisans?
</p>
    
    <h2>The Story Unfolds</h2>
    
<p>Science has always been news, but as a specialty it took hold in <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com">Scientific American</a>, a magazine founded in 1845 and still in the vanguard of popular science news. The print and online magazines are aimed at an educated but not necessarily science-educated audience. 
</p>
<figure class="right"><img src="scimages/sciamold.jpg" width="180" height="265" alt="sciamold" title="sciamold" class="right"/><figcaption>Scientific American, 1845</figcaption></figure>

<figure class="right"><img src="scimages/sciamnew.jpg" width="180" height="265" alt="sciamnew" title="sciamnew" class="right"/><figcaption>Scientific American today</figcaption></figure>
    
<p>By 1934, there were enough science writers to organize the <a href="http://www.nasw.org">National Association of Science Writers</a>, which numbers more than 2,000 today.
</p>
<p>As vaccines solved problems like polio, and physicists split atoms, and the Russians sent the first rocket into space, science writing played an ever more important role in explaining the world.
</p>

<figure class="right"><img src="scimages/sputnik.jpeg" width="186" height="270" alt="sputnik" title="sputnik" class="right"/><figcaption>Stamp commemorating Sputnik launch</figcaption></figure>
     
<p>By 1978, the New York Times had started its Science Times section, and today it is the model for print science reporting. With 19 staff members, the Times has <figure class="right"><img src="scimages/scitimes.jpeg" width="100" height="100" alt="scitimes" title="scitimes" class="right"/><figcaption>Science Times</figcaption></figure>
    by far the largest science news reporting staff. Other newspapers followed the Times’ lead, and science sections published on a weekly basis peaked in 1989 at 95, according to a report, <a href="https://www.amacad.org/content/publications/pubContent.aspx?d=1092">Covering Controversial Science: Improving Reporting on Science and Public Policy</a>, for the Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University by Cristine Russell, a freelance science journalist. Russell reported that by 1992, only 44 newspapers had weekly science news sections and by 2006, only 24 of those remained.
</p>
    

<p>Many of the remaining science news sections morphed into blended science/health/fitness sections in an effort to keep readers interested. As the newspaper industry went into free-fall, science writers were seen as expendable, as Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum reported in 2009 in Nation.
</p>
<p>In their article, <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/unpopular-science">Unpopular Science</a>, Mooney and Kirshenbaum give an example of a science writer who specialized in global health and infectious disease, who was laid off from a major newspaper in 2009 just as swine flu was threatening the U.S. The person in the best position to cover that story wasn’t writing it, a loss to readers who wanted to know how to protect themselves from swine flu.
</p>
<p>Science writers have functioned as the translators between science breakthroughs and controversies and the general public. The best of them speak geek, and English, too. As the science reporting corps dwindles, science news falls to general assignment reporters, who often are ill-equipped for the topic or don’t want the assignment, or both. This means stories that could be among the most important news of the day often get the least care.
</p>
    
    <h2>Science Moves Online</h2>
    
<p>Even as science sections ceased publication and science writers were laid off, the ranks of science writers grew. In cyberspace, there is room for everyone.
</p> 
<p>Science news has exploded on the internet. Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum conservatively estimated in their 2009 Nation article that 1,000 science blogs are operating online. The National Science Foundation reported in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind14/">Science and Engineering Indicators 2014</a> that four out of five Americans say they are interested in scientific discoveries, with 40 percent turning to online sources for that news. 
</p>
    
<figure class="right"><img src="scimages/nisbet.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="nisbet" title="nisbet" class="right"/><figcaption>Matthew Nisbet</figcaption></figure>

<p>Media scholar Matthew Nisbet wrote in 2011 that his study of how the practice of science journalism is changing as it moves online revealed a huge diversity of science news sources: blogs, a variety of social media, general science web sites, web sites devoted to a specific science topic and advocacy sites all provided multiple points of entry into science news stories, and multiple interpretations of science news. 
</p>
<p>This makes for a wild and woolly time online; scientists, writers, bloggers, journalists, people with an ax to grind, those with an agenda and readers, are all engaging in science communication. Facts blend with opinion, making the reader who simply wants information or an explanation work harder to find news in the traditional style.
</p>
<p>My own experience researching the topic of genetic modification of food bears this out. A multitude of sources, seemingly legitimate, have reported that genetically modified corn harms butterflies in the environment, based on a small laboratory study in which captive monarch butterflies died after they were fed exclusively GM corn. Multiple efforts to replicate the study in the wild were unsuccessful, debunking the study’s claims, but finding the follow-up news requires much effort online. In the mix of ideology and science, the science is lost.
</p>
<p>Mooney and Kirshenbaum found this, too, pointing out that the 2008 Weblog Awards for science came down to a site devoted to confrontational atheism vs. a climate change skeptic. This speaks volumes about the caliber of science “news” online.
</p>
<p>Andrew Revkin, who writes the <a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com">Dot Earth</a> blog published by the New York Times, told Nesbit, “most blogs are built to provide a comfort zone for a particular ideological camp....” Revkin said he tries in his blog to provide a forum for all voices. The Columbia Journalism Review’s Curtis Brainard told Nesbit that the online milieu is particularly suited to those “deep diving” into a particular science topic. While this approach is valuable, it differs substantially from the traditional newspaper model, in which readers are exposed to a variety of news topics.
</p>
    
    <h2>The Rock Stars of Science Storytelling</h2>
    
<p>Scientists who can communicate can do without the journalist as middleman. 
Media scholar Matthew Nisbet interviewed Eli Kintisch of Science magazine and Science Insider, who told him that the journalist’s role was changed by the fact that often “scientists themselves have blogged about the paper or event,” the journalist no longer functioning as a conduit.
</p>
<p>Savvy scientists use their own blogs, web sites, Facebook pages and Twitter accounts to communicate with a lay audience. The ones who do it well can become science rock stars.
</p>

<figure class="right"><img src="scimages/neil.jpg" width="337" height="368" alt="neil" title="neil" class="right"/><figcaption>Neil deGrasse Tyson</figcaption></figure>

<figure class="right"><img src="scimages/cosmos.jpg" width="337" height="170" alt="cosmos" title="cosmos" class="right"/><figcaption>Cosmos</figcaption></figure> 
  
<p>Perhaps no scientist embodies this more than Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the <a href="http://www.amnh.org/our-research/hayden-planetarium">Hayden Planetarium</a> at the American Museum of Natural History and host of Fox Television’s <a href="http://www.cosmosontv.com">Cosmos</a>. Although he is an astrophysicist, Tyson has, for all intents and purposes, become the modern spokesman for all of science, filling the shoes, perhaps, of former Cosmos host Carl Sagan. 
</p>
<p>Most scientists believe the public is ill-informed about science, including topics commonly in the news, like climate change, genetic modification and bioterrorism, according to John Besley and Nisbet, in their article, <a href="http://pus.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/08/26/0963662511418743.full.pdf">How Scientists View the Public, the Media and the Political Process</a> in the journal Public Understanding of Science. Furthermore, they say, most scientists believe the public has little interest in gaining more knowledge.
</p>
<p>Good science communication, Tyson argues, can change that. On a <a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/neil_degrasse_tyson_communicating_science/">Point of Inquiry</a> podcast in 2011, Tyson said, “ . . . my tact as a scientist and as an educator, from my earliest days has been to really try to get people to understand the causes and effects of things and the operations of nature at its most basic level . . .”
</p>

<figure class="right"><img src="scimages/billnye.jpeg" width="340" height="200" alt="billnye" title="billnye" class="right"/><figcaption>Bill Nye the Science Guy</figcaption></figure>

<p>Tyson and other science rock stars -- Bill Nye the Science Guy, Ira Flatow of NPR’s <a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com">Science Friday</a>, Richard Dawkins, and others --  also fill this role. And increasingly, graduate students are being trained to communicate their own science via programs like the <a href="http://threeminutethesis.org">Three Minute Thesis</a>, a research communication competition. The program started at the University of Queensland in 2008 and is gaining popularity, spreading to 170 universities in 17 countries. The students, usually doctoral candidates, are charged with presenting their research in just three minutes in language a lay audience can understand.
</p>
<p>The University of Florida hosted its first Three Minute Thesis competition in April. Below is a classic example, this one from Australia.
</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LeKuX4LwllQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <!--dropbox link goes here-->
    
<p>Media scholar Chris Mooney says it is especially important for graduate students in the sciences to get training in science communication considering “the journalists who might once have been expected to do this work simply don’t have jobs any longer.”
</p>
<p>And if events like the Origins Project’s Science of Storytelling/Storytelling of Science panel are an indication, the scientists can draw a crowd. Held at Arizona State University, the event featured astrophysicist Tyson, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, Bill Nye the Science Guy and others, simply discussing science stories in front of a sold-out crowd for two nights in 2013.
</p>
<p>For those interested, the taped event is here.</p>

    <h2>Lingering Role for Legacy Media</h2>
    
<p>The importance of legacy media to the online science news enterprise, at least for now, cannot be denied, media scholar Matthew Nisbet points out, when you consider that 80 percent of all science news links point to the BBC, CNN, the New York Times or the Washington Post. In a National Science Foundation survey, most of the readers seeking science news online said they used online editions of newspapers. 
</p>
<p>Newspapers do two things that seem to be in short supply in the blogosphere. First, they serve as a curator for the plethora of science news available today. People still turn to newspapers, whether in print or online, to find a sort of table of contents for the news of the day. They may not read it all, but they will have an awareness of what is considered useful to know as a citizen of the world on a given day. Secondly, readers still trust newspapers for explanatory journalism, whether or not they identify a newspaper as liberal or conservative. As science blogger/writer <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/blog/not-exactly-rocket-science/">Ed Yong</a> says, “the very simple act of making complex things simple is tremendously valuable.”
</p>
<p>Science news consumers who read only the blogs with which their views align are missing out on the perspective a good newspaper provides. In a world ever more diverse, how do we broaden our horizons if we don’t try to know more than our own corner of the world and challenge our own beliefs.
