    <h1>Chunking Science</h1>
    
    <h2>MMC 5015 Your Digital Life Project</h2>
		
</header>
	
    <p>As a graduate student in the science and health communication track and as a writer in the University of Florida Office of Research, I have a strong interest in science news.

</p>
    <p>Writing about science is a lot like newspaper reporting, it takes you places you wouldn’t have gone otherwise. I’ve flown with a weed scientist over a nature preserve being swallowed up by invasive vines, gone along with a wildlife researcher tagging barn owls and hiked through saw palmettos with a scientist studying their value as a pharmaceutical crop. I’ve held a bat and observed an alligator necropsy. Science is often fun, almost always interesting, and I almost always come away wishing I had paid more attention in long-ago chemistry and physics classes (the researchers likely wish this, too).

</p>
    <p>From climate change to the ways we mine big data to the anti-science that rears its head in policy circles, science is a hot topic, so that is my class project for MMC 5015 Your Digital Life, hopefully “chunked” appropriately per the professor’s instructions.
</p>
    <h2>Science is News</h2>
    
    <p>The digital revolution of the last 25 years has done to the world of science what it has done to the rest of the world: quickened the pace. 

</p>
    <p>As citizens of the world, all of us, digital natives and immigrants alike, try to keep up with the pace of change, learning new technologies, integrating them into our lives, then learning the next thing. Science does this, too.

</p>
    <p>James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the molecular structure of DNA in 1953. When the U.S. embarked on the quest to map the human genome in 1990, scientists thought it would take 15 years and $3 billion. It took 13 years – thanks to improvements in computing power – and cost $2.7 billion. By 2003, a mere 50 years since Watson and Crick discovered the double helix, the human genome was sequenced.

    <figure class="right"><img src="scimages/dnastructure.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="dna" title="dna" class="right"/><figcaption>The Double Helix</figcaption></figure>
    <p>Today, you can swab your mouth and send your DNA to any of a number of labs, and for $99 find out an assortment of data points about your own genetic code.

</p>
    <p>The question becomes how do we process this knowledge? Personally, and as a society, who helps us figure out what our personal genetic code really means, and who deciphers the latest discoveries in science?

</p>
    <p>Traditionally, science journalists have filled this role. So who does it when the science reporters are gone, or worse, replaced by science partisans?

</p>
    <h2>The Story Unfolds</h2>
    <p>Science has always been news, but as a specialty it took hold in Scientific American, a magazine founded in 1845 and still in the vanguard of popular science news. The print and online magazines are aimed at an educated but not necessarily science-educated audience. 

</p>
    <figure class="right"><img src="scimages/sciamold.jpg" width="186" height="270" alt="sciamold" title="sciamnew" class="right"/><figcaption>Scientific American, 1845</figcaption></figure>
    <figure class="right"><img src="scimages/sciamnew.jpg" width="186" height="270" alt="sciamnew" title="sciamnew" class="right"/><figcaption>Scientific American today</figcaption></figure>
    
    <p>By 1934, there were enough science writers to organize the National Association of Science Writers, which numbers more than 2,000 today.

</p>
    <p>As vaccines solved problems like polio, and physicists split atoms, and the Russians sent the first rocket into space, science writing played an ever more important role in explaining the world.

</p>

    <p>By 1978, the New York Times had started its Science Times section, and today it is the model for print science reporting. With 19 staff members, the Times has by far the largest science news reporting staff. Other newspapers followed the Times’ lead, and science sections published on a weekly basis peaked in 1989 at 95, according to a report, Covering Controversial Science: Improving Reporting on Science and Public Policy, for the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University by Cristine Russell, a freelance science journalist. Russell reported that by 1992, only 44 newspapers had weekly science news sections and by 2006, only 24 of those remained.

</p>
    <figure class="right"><img src="scimages/scitimes.jpeg" width="100" height="100" alt="scitimes" title="scitimes" class="right"/><figcaption>Science Times</figcaption></figure>
    
    <p>Many of the remaining science news sections morphed into blended science/health/fitness sections in an effort to keep readers interested. As the newspaper industry went into free-fall, science writers were seen as expendable, as Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum reported in 2009 in Nation.
</p>
    <p>In their article, “Unpopular Science,” Mooney and Kirshenbaum give an example of a science writer who specialized in global health and infectious disease, who was laid off from a major newspaper in 2009 just as swine flu was threatening the U.S. The person in the best position to cover that story wasn’t writing it, a loss to readers who wanted to know how to protect themselves from swine flu.
</p>
    <p>Science writers have functioned as the translators between science breakthroughs and controversies and the general public. The best of them speak geek, and English, too. As the science reporting corps dwindles, science news falls to general assignment reporters, who often are ill-equipped for the topic or don’t want the assignment, or both. This means stories that could be among the most important news of the day often get the least care.

</p>
    <h2>Science Moves Online</h2>
    <p>Even as science sections ceased publication and science writers were laid off, the ranks of science writers have grown. In cyberspace, there is room for everyone.
