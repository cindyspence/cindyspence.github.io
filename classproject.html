    <h1>Chunking Science</h1>
    
    <h2>MMC 5015 Your Digital Life Project</h2>
		
</header>
	
    <p>As a graduate student in the science and health communication track and as a writer in the University of Florida Office of Research, I have a strong interest in science news.

</p>
    <p>Writing about science is a lot like newspaper reporting, it takes you places you wouldn’t have gone otherwise. I’ve flown with a weed scientist over a nature preserve being swallowed up by invasive vines, gone along with a wildlife researcher tagging barn owls and hiked through saw palmettos with a scientist studying their value as a pharmaceutical crop. I’ve held a bat and observed an alligator necropsy. Science is often fun, almost always interesting, and I almost always come away wishing I had paid more attention in long-ago chemistry and physics classes (the researchers likely wish this, too).

</p>
    <p>From climate change to the ways we mine big data to the anti-science that rears its head in policy circles, science is a hot topic, so that is my class project for MMC 5015 Your Digital Life, hopefully “chunked” appropriately per the professor’s instructions.
</p>
    <h2>Science is News</h2>
    
    <p>The digital revolution of the last 25 years has done to the world of science what it has done to the rest of the world: quickened the pace. 

</p>
    <p>As citizens of the world, all of us, digital natives and immigrants alike, try to keep up with the pace of change, learning new technologies, integrating them into our lives, then learning the next thing. Science does this, too.

</p>
    <p>James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the molecular structure of DNA in 1953. When the U.S. embarked on the quest to map the human genome in 1990, scientists thought it would take 15 years and $3 billion. It took 13 years – thanks to improvements in computing power – and cost $2.7 billion. By 2003, a mere 50 years since Watson and Crick discovered the double helix, the human genome was sequenced.

    <p>Today, you can swab your mouth and send your DNA to any of a number of labs, and for $99 find out an assortment of data points about your own genetic code.
