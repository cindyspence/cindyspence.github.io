    <h2>Travels</h2>
		
</header>
	
    <p>For a military brat, travel is almost as natural as breathing, but even in my nomadic younger years, I never crossed an ocean.
</p>
    <p>So when my father was transferred to 17th Air Force headquarters in Europe in the mid 1980s, I seized an opportunity I knew would not come around again. I had only been at The Orlando Sentinel, working as a reporter and bureau chief, for a few years, a great job, and I was torn: stay in the great job or hit the road.
</p>
    <p>I hit the road. My parents were in Sembach, Germany, and all I needed to know about it I learned from looking at a map: from Sembach I could go anywhere in Europe. I had grown up enough to enjoy my parents’ company, so staying with them in between excursions here and there would be ideal. I would have a place to stop and wash clothes and eat a home-cooked meal and sleep in my own bed in between trips. 
</p>
    <p>I left my Honda and Scoop the cat with a friend, packed one suitcase and boarded an airplane for Frankfurt.
</p>
    <p>The ability to live in a place as opposed to just visiting is a rare privilege. You can soak up a culture when you don’t have to hurry. If you like a place – a bakery, an inn, a museum – you can always go back.
</p>
    <h3>Heidelberg</h3>
    <p>For day trips, I borrowed the family car, a boxy Ford Thunderbird. Nothing says “crazy American” like a Thunderbird going under 100 mph on the Autobahn (I never got up the nerve to go faster). The Germans generally don’t honk, but they flash their headlights, a signal to pick up the pace.
</p>
    <p>Heidelberg was a favorite destination for a day trip, a one-hour drive (much less than that for German drivers). I often went to Heidelberg for no special reason, sometimes just to have lunch and practice my German and window shop on the walkplatz, which had almost as many cafes as shops.
</p>
    <p>Later, after I met a German student on a ski trip, I got to see the city through the eyes of students at the University of Heidelberg. The city had a young vibe, thanks to the students, but kept its historic flavor, too, a lovely blend. The ruins of Heidelberg Castle, though not Germany’s most famous or most beautiful, nevertheless are imposing, nestled against a hillside overlooking the River Neckar, visible from the old town center. The castle was beautiful by day, stunning on occasions when it was lighted at night.
</p>
    <h3>Berlin, East meets West</h3>
    <p>One of the highlights of the year I spent in Germany was a trip to Berlin. Getting to Berlin meant leaving West Germany and traveling through East Germany. Even without passing through the checkpoint, it was obvious I was entering a different world, one in which soldiers patrolled with guns at their sides and fences topped with razor wire lined the road connecting east and west. Arriving in West Berlin, I stayed in lodgings for military and dependents at Tempelhof Airport, an imposing historic structure, even today billed as the fourth-largest building in the world. West Berlin was lively and cosmopolitan, true to its reputation as a city that never sleeps. 
</p>
    <p>East Berlin was almost West Berlin’s opposite. Getting in meant entering through Checkpoint Charlie and getting the death stare from the soldier who checked my passport. I made a beeline for Unter den Linden, the grand historic boulevard, and Museum Island. The historic heart of Berlin and its famed museums ended up under Soviet control when the Allies carved up the city during World War II and afterward.  Trying to squeeze the Pergamon Museum with its antiquities, the Altes Museum with Egyptian artifacts and the National Gallery, with its 19th century German paintings into an afternoon was the goal. I didn’t anticipate the fall of the Berlin Wall and figured this would be my only chance to see the treasures these museums held.
</p>
    <p>I dined in Alexanderplatz and shopped a little, noticing the shelves were sparsely stocked, with big gaps where products would be in a West German store, a sign of Cold War economics. I bought a federdecke, or feather blanket, a little piece of Germany that I pull out every winter, and felt a little guilty that I had the resources, even on my meager budget, to buy something many East Germans could not.
</p>
    <p>Soldiers were ever-present and armed. The good-natured bustle of West Berlin was markedly absent in East Berlin. Passing back through Checkpoint Charlie by curfew that evening, I peered at the wall, mostly gray on the eastern side, marked with bright graffiti on the western side, and could understand why someone might risk jumping it for a chance at freedom.
</p>
    <h3>French hospitality</h3>
    <p>France is all the postcard things you think of: the sights and sounds of Paris and the picturesque coast on the Mediterranean. But when I think of France, I think of a particular meal on a summer lawn under the trees of an inn. I was traveling with my parents to a military function and, with evening approaching, we were lost. When we stopped to ask directions, a nice French woman and her daughter took us back to their home, where the woman called around to find lodging for us overnight. She recommended a place to dine where we were the only Americans and she and her daughter joined us for dinner, a very French experience, and that night I slept in a small inn in an attic room with a window open to the stars of the French sky. I had been told the French would be hostile, and my experience was anything but. Our family stayed in touch with the woman and her daughter for a number of years, even after returning to the States.
    </p>
    <h3>Mountains</h3>
    <p>The first time I ever skied was in the Alps in Austria, near Innsbruck, which has twice hosted the winter Olympics. My prowess was not Olympian: I fell off the T-bar lift and had to be rescued by a nice German boy, who treated me to my first mug of mulled wine at the lodge atop the mountain. That helped my courage. I returned to the slopes, holding on to the lift, ski tips pointed up this time, and fell in love with skiing. When I returned to the States, the sport became the reason for winter pilgrimages to Breckenridge, Colorado, until I married a sports writer and found that I had married football and basketball seasons, too.
</p>
    <p>Snow-covered ski resorts are breathtaking, and I can’t think of a sport as exhilarating as downhill skiing, but spring in a ski resort might be just as nice in its own way. Stateside, I have found that true in Whistler in British Columbia and in Vail, Colorado, both great for hiking, biking and other outdoor activities. It would be impossible to be bored in the Alps in the spring. The Alps of Bavaria that straddle the German-Austrian border are not as soaring as the Swiss Alps, but still plenty high. Hitler situated his Eagle’s Nest retreat atop the Hoher Goll, one of the higher peaks in Berchtesgaden. It’s worth the trip both for the history and the view. 
</p>
    <p>None of the acclaimed Four Thousanders (Alpine peaks of 4,000 feet or higher) are in Germany or Austria, all 82 clustered in Switzerland, France and Italy, yet the Alps of Bavaria in some ways are more picturesque, perhaps because the mountainsides are dotted with villages and farms. Driving once into the Swiss Alps, I found myself on a road that crested a mountain, higher than any neighboring peak and with nothing else around, having passed a small roadside inn about an hour earlier, and felt truly isolated – and queasy driving back down. In Germany, there would have been an inn there.
</p>
    <h3>The Black Forest and castles</h3>
    <p>North of Bavaria as you cross the Rhine River in southwest Germany is the Black Forest. The forest got its name because the trees grew so thick that little sunlight filtered down to the forest floor. During the mid 1980s, however, pollution began to take its toll and Germans became involved in environmental activism designed to raise awareness about the plight of the forest. From the roadside, it was easy to see the discolored branches of the evergreens – firs and pines – that had succumbed to pollution. In the forest interior, however, the tree canopy still blocked much of the sunlight. You can walk or hike in from many locations. I opted for a horse-drawn carriage ride on a chilly winter day, with a blanket over my lap and the driver supplying a glass of apfelwein, a cider much beloved in Germany. From the paths inside, enveloped by trees, the Black Forest was still a romantic and mysterious place.
</p>
    <p>Horse-drawn carriages also deliver guests to many German castles, including Castle Neuschwanstein on a forested cliff and nearby Hohenschwangau Castle in the valley below. Neuschwanstein is famous as a model for Disney princess castles and deserves its notoriety. There are certainly more imposing castles, but none more lyrical in design. King Ludwig II, who had the castle built in the late 1800s, spared no expense and chose the location for its beauty and remote, cliffside site.
</p>
    <h3>Food</h3>
    <p>Only a few years removed from college rations of coffee and bagels and Krishna largesse, dining on the cheap (except for the military banquets my parents cajoled me into attending) was not so bad. Food, I think, is seasoned by geography. The chocolate tasted better everywhere in Europe than it had in the States. Breakfast commonly consisted of a basket of warm breads, with butter and jam, perfect sustenance for a day of touring. Lunch en route could be coffee and a pastry or piece of fruit from a street vendor. Things sometimes got interesting at dinner. In Koln, I was served a fish with its head still on, its eye staring up accusingly, making it difficult to eat. McDonald’s seemed to be everywhere, so in Frankfurt, for kicks, I bought a burger and fries, something I had to do once for the sake of comparison. The hamburgers don’t taste the same. French fries were ubiquitous. Every culture seems to have a version, and on any menu I couldn’t decipher, the pommes frittes were a safe bet. The German beer and French wine were as good as billed in Frommer’s, but I think the best coffee in the world is in Salzburg (with The Mean Cup in Lancaster, Pa., a runner-up).
</p>
    <h3>A military presence</h3>
    <p>As a grown-up military brat with access to U.S. installations via my father, I saw Europe through two lenses: as someone distinctly identified as American and someone viewed as a fellow traveler through the world. When I traveled with my parents for military functions, we often drove through raucous crowds of protesters to get to the base gate. Ronald Reagan had called the Soviet Union the evil empire and was going gangbusters on his space-based, missile-defense Star Wars program. The nuclear arms race was in full force. Many of the bases I visited were nuclear missile installations, and I recall reading somewhere there were as many as 75 bases throughout Europe with nuclear missiles. The nuclear question was the hot-button issue for the protesters, but in talking with my German friends, it was clear the American presence in Germany – you could cross West Germany by hopping base to base if you wanted to – was a strong undercurrent. The military functions I attended were mostly mixed affairs with representatives of most of the NATO forces. The carrot my parents used to get me to go with them to military functions was a free trip somewhere I hadn’t yet visited, but truth be told, it was fun to dress up on occasion and dance with a dashing young officer here or there.
</p>
    <p>One such trip coincided with Reagan’s visit to Bitburg, Germany in May 1985, on his way to the G7 economic summit in Bonn. The plan was to commemorate V-E Day and thank German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for standing by Reagan during deployment in previous years of Pershing II missiles on German soil. They planned to visit a cemetery to honor allied soldiers who died in World War II. The only problem was there were no Americans buried there – but there were Nazi war dead. It was a PR nightmare for the president.
</p>
    <p>My Dad got me into the large arrival party, and I saw the president disembark and later lay a wreath at Kolmeshohe Cemetery. Reagan finessed it as best he could, speaking of the world as a victim of the Nazis, Germans included. The visit was protested more in the states than in Germany.
</p>
    <p>Two years later, Reagan would stand at the Brandenburg Gate and exhort Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down this wall.” The news junkie in me was glued to CNN two more years later as the German Democratic Republic gave up on the wall, announcing on Nov. 9, 1989, that residents could travel freely to the west. Crowds attacked the wall, and in the days that followed, it fell. My Dad gave me a chunk of concrete from the wall, and although it looks like any other chunk of concrete, I hold on to it, anyway.
</p>
    <h3>The end</h3>
    <p>By the time I had bounced around the Netherlands and Belgium, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein, Zurich and Basel and Lucerne, Barcelona and Zaragosa and Madrid, Andorra and the Pyrenees, and crossed the English Channel into London, I knew a year was not long enough. I had scheduled a trip to Budapest and was making plans to move overseas, sell my car and import my cat (major quarantine rules) when I got a rare long-distance call. A friend’s father had died. A day later, I boarded a plane from Frankfurt to New York to Miami. And fell back into my American life.
</p>
    <p>I still treasure travel, now with my family. My daughter first saw snow on Mount Rainier, and a bear and cubs in the wild in British Columbia. She saw her first Broadway show at 12, and her second a day later. I remember visiting the Little Bighorn while rereading “Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,” and being tugged on by a kid who didn’t understand what there was to see. But she remembers that we detoured to the Blue Bell Lodge in Custer State Park in South Dakota, just because it was listed in her Food Network Magazine as the best place to have breakfast in South Dakota (long detour, late breakfast). She enjoyed San Francisco and Yosemite so much she begged for years to go back. Then we went to the Rocky Mountains, and she begged to go back there. I know the feeling, the tug of a place, the urge to see and learn more. Maybe wanderlust runs in the family.
